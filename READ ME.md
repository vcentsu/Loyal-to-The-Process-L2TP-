#  Loyal to The Process (L2TP)

Hi WWDC2022! My name is Vincentius Sutanto, or just call me Centsu. I'm a Computer Science Student and an Intern in Apple Developer Academy @GOP BINUS. Nice to meet you!


BACKGROUND STORY
====================================================================================================
I am the type of person who has a very competitive character, which is good. However, this trait is what makes me dislike with failure or defeat. I used to feel like I don't wanna try something again after giving it all my best then failing to get what i dreamed of and wanted. Oftentimes, I feel jealous when I meet a friend who has achieved a great things, while I haven't. And of course, it gives me feelings of insecurity and deep depression.

Long story short, I was accepted to Apple Developer Academy, which the mentors of the academy claimed that it was a safe place to fail. This is one of the reasons for me to keep try and never give up even when I fail. In the academy, I realized that all this time I've been only focused on the result, and if the result isn't how I expect it to be or how I want it to be, that means it is bad result. And I'm going to be very dissapointed about it. However, it turns out that what I was doing is wrong. I should've been focusing on the process. Going through a long process is not an easy task which is why I have to be proud of what I've gone through. Failing? WOOHOOOOO! I'm proud of it! Failing shapes humans and that's the part of the PROCESS. Never mind about the result. I remembered a quote that said "Rainbow always comes after the rain!" and I believe it. Yes, the entire process is going to make a good end result. Maybe not for today, but the process is going to be very useful for me (AND THAT'S A GOOD RESULT).

It's the same in joining Swift Student Challenge, I focusing on learning, trying, doing, joining, til submitting. And that's a process that I have to go through. I have to be submit the challenge. Obviously I want to win, but I believe, if I haven't won, there will be good things waiting for me ahead. 

So, all my thoughts, feelings, ups and downs from this process I poured into a masterpiece called "Loyal to The Process" or L2TP.  This swift playground project is a simple game about mindset on focusing on the process, rather than chasing the end result. And hopefully, when many children and teen like "Centsu" use this app, they will understand and enjoy every process.


DESCRIPTION
====================================================================================================
 This is my very first swift playground project called "Loyal to The Process (L2TP)" about mindset on focusing on the process, rather than chasing the end result. My main target is for children and young teenager to understand and enjoy every process.

I used SwiftUI and AVFoundation to build this playground. I also used interaction such as tap and drag to give more interactive. I also used navigation tab for each page when the game starts. All the assets and resources are free-to-use. And some of them are made by myself hehehe...

Inside, there are 2 simple games that can be played. The first game called "Learn from The Process" is to sort the numbers from the smallest to the largest. In this game there is "How To Play" to give more information to play. The second game called "Trust The Process" is to try to drag the colors and see the result. If you want to return to the main page, the user can press the last navigation tab, which contains the "Back to Home" button.
